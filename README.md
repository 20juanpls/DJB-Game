# DJB-Game

Omar ... I already did. Got some respawning done, making good progress. I'll be keeping a list of things I think we need.

Need to Do
1) Respawning (Fix)
2) NPC Suicide (Tweak)
3) Etc


Noah ... If you want to start making NPCs for the game, make sure you add the gravity script if the NPC's react 
to gravity and make sure that their vertor 3 diretions are the same as the quaternion angle they are standing at
the instance, I'll add something to the gravity script that changes the direction of the vectors from the script 
instead of just the player script sometime later ...  (unless u want them to float or something...).
-Anyway ... I'll start on making the basic mechanics, you can start with the NPCs, and we should be done by the 
end of Thanksgiving break.
PS. If you want to meet somewhere during the break, we should discuss that as soon as we can...
PPS. Forgive my overuse of ellipsis(...) here is a spook skeleton
